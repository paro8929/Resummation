---------------------------------------
Setting parameters: Zero temperature
---------------------------------------

Modify the files R2.cpp (or R3.cpp)

- Value of interaction: change the parameter "interaction" (which is g=lambda/mR^2) to an appropriate value

- Resolution of integration: change the parameter "N0"  to an appropriate value; note that corresponding to your choice of N0, an appropriate file "Leg-Quad-NXX.dat" must be present in the "LegendreData" subdirectory where xx=N0-1
  (R3 only: change the parameter "N1" to an appropriate value for adjusting the resolution of the angular interpolation in the vertex function)

- Maximum number of iterations: change the parameter "mIT" to an appropriate value

- Maximum value of K^2 in self-energies: change the parameter "cut" to an appropriate value

---------------------------------------
Setting parameters: Finite temperature
---------------------------------------

Modify the files finiteT2d-R2.cpp (or finiteT2d-R3.cpp)


- Value of the fiducial mass scale: change the parameter "m02" (which is mF^2/lambda) to an appropriate value

- Resolution of thermal sums: change the parameter "N0"  to an appropriate value; note that your choice of N0 corresponds to the number of Matsubara frequencies included in the calculation (should be increased when lowering the temperature)

- Resolution of integration: change the parameter "N1" to an appropriate value; note that corresponding to your choice of N0, an appropriate file "Leg-Quad-NXX.dat" must be present in the "LegendreData" subdirectory where xx=N0-1

- Temperature: set the parameter "Temp" (corresponding to T/Sqrt(lambda)) to an appropriate value 

- Maximum number of iterations: change the parameter "mIT" to an appropriate value

- Maximum value of K^2 in self-energies: change the parameter "cut" to an appropriate value

--------------------------------------

Compiling the code: use ./compile

Output: R2.exe, R3.exe, finTR2.exe, finTR3.exe

Note: shell script assumes that gsl and openmp libraries are present and installed at your machine, and your compiler is c++11 standard compliant.


Single thread compiling: It is possible to remove dependence on openmp by uncommenting all "#pragma" pre-processor commands in the code if you insist on running on single thread


-------------------------------------

Running the code and inspecting results

Use ./R2.exe (./R3.exe, ./finTR2.exe, ./finTT3.exe) to run the code

Code runs multiple iterations (governed by "mIT" parameter, see above) to converge to correct results for self-energies and vertices. Code outputs progress to std and results to "history" (and "final") files in the "store" subdirectory.

---------------------------------------

Output files:

"history-R*zeroT-xxx.dat" (zero temperature)

Columns correspond to iteration number, delta m^2, delta Pi(K=0), Lambda/mR^2, M/mR, c2 and error in c2. If successfully converged, the content of rows will be identical after a sufficient number of iterations

"history-R*-xxx.dat" (finite temperature)

Columns correspond to iteration number, delta m^2, delta Pi(K=0), Pressure/lambda, unused. If successfully converged, the content of rows will be identical after a sufficient number of iterations
